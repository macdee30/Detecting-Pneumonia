# Detecting-Pneumonia
AIM: To develop a model that can classify Chest Xrays as Pneumonia and normal

KEY STEPS: 1) Dealed with image data sets 2)Performed Data Processing and Augmentation 3)Created and trained Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow 2.0

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

In this project, I developed a model that can be used to classify Xray images as either a normal one or one showing traces of pneumonia.
