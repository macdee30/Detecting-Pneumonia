CLASSIFICATION OF CHEST XRAY AS PNEUMONIA OR NORMAL
AIM: To develop a model that can classify Chest Xrays as Pneumonia and normal

KEY STEPS: 1) Dealed with image data sets 2)Performed Data Processing and Augmentation 3)Created and trained Convolutional Neural Network using tensorflow 2.0

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

What is Pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs infection can be life-threatening to anyone. The germs that cause Pneumonia are very contagious

Symptoms
1) COughing that may produce mucus.
2) Sweating or chills.
3) Shortness of breath
4) Chest pain
5) Feeling of tiredness of fatigue
6) Headache

Diagnosis
1) Physical Check-ups: chest X-ray, Blood Culture, Sputum Culture, Pulse Oximetry, CT scan, Fluid sample

 
 How Chest X-rays are related to Pneumonia disease
1) An X-ray exam will allow a doctor to see lungs, heart and blood vessels etc to determine the presense of pneumonia.
2)Infiltrates that identify an infection.
3)Low contrast, overlapping organs and blurred boundary.

So with the above, it becomes difficult for medical doctors to easily spot an Xray image indicating Pneomonia. So it is of medical value and application significance to construct a stable and accurate automatic detection model of pneumonia. 


In this project, I developed a model that can be used to classify Xray images as either a normal one or one showing traces of pneumonia.
